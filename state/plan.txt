I have a React Native pixel-art editor built with react-native-paper, react-native-svg, and Redux.
Keep all my existing logic exactly the same (Redux actions, reducer, drawing logic, canvas logic, layer logic, frame logic).
Do NOT rewrite or replace any logic — only update UI layout and styling.

I want you to output updated React Native components and styles that make the UI look similar to Pixilart (pixilart.com/draw), but not copied.

Requirements:

• Keep my Canvas logic and props exactly the same.
• Keep my Redux store, reducer, and actions exactly as-is.
• Only rewrite layout + styles of components (PixelArtEditor, LeftToolbar, RightSidebar, Timeline).
• New layout structure:
– Left vertical toolbar (~64px width) with tool icons + color preview
– Center canvas area with checkerboard background and padded wrapper
– Right sidebar (~280px) containing preview, layers panel, palette
– Bottom timeline for frames
– Top app bar with undo / redo / download
– FAB group for brush sizes

• Use react-native-paper + react-native-svg.
• Dark theme UI similar to Pixilart: clean, modern, dark grey panels, highlights for active tools, rounded corners.

Output:

Updated component code

Updated styles file

Minimal changes, preserve all existing logic
